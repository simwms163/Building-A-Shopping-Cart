Building-A-Shopping-Cart

## Summary
a
The Building Cart Project allows me to setup a shopping cart using Javascript.
I was able to learn how to setup a shopping cart for a supermarket.
I didn't make any changes to the HTML or the CSS.

## The function codes I used to setup the shopping cart

let cart = [];
function addProductToCart(productId) 
function increaseQuantity(productId) 
function decreaseQuantity(productId)
function removeProductFromCart(productId) 
function cartTotal()
function emptyCart()
function pay(amount)

## A few of the setup guidelines for the shopping cart

Create an array named products which you will use to add all of your product object literals that you create in the next step. 
Declare an empty array named cart to hold the items in the cart 
Create a function named addProductToCart that takes in the product productId as an argument
Create a function named cartTotal that has no parameters

# Leason Learned

Building the shopping cart project allows me to dive deeper into Javascript.
